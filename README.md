## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used Flexbox for the header section and Grid to style the notifications section.

The notification dot is implemented using a CSS pseudo-element.

### Continued development

I want to keep practicing Grid.

### Useful resources

- [MDN article about the `::after` selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::after) - This helped with implementing the notification dot.
